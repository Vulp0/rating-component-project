## My process

### Built with

- **React** (create-react-app)
- Layout prototyped and copied with **Figma**

### What I learned

I've learnt that i'm not that incompetent, that i can actually finish projects lol.

But seriously, i find it easier to work on projects when i get to figure out the design first in Figma and *then* start working on actually building the site, instead of building and doing both at the same time. 

### Continued development

I want to focus more ona couple of things:
- Working on and finishing projects quicker
- Putting out more projects in general - getting more mileage would really help my confidence
- Need to get a better eye for design - i want my sites to be more visually appealing and better designed
